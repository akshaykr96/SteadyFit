# SteadyFit

Description:

    Parkinson’s patients suffer from physical and phsychological symptoms which interfere with their daily lives. Many medical or surgical treatments cannot resolve those symptoms, as it is a progressive disease. However, studies show regular exercise has shown to be effective in managing these symptoms.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]

    In effort to help, we created SteadyFit. This is an iOS-based all-in-one scheduler app, which allow Parkinson’s patients to join nearby groups with other patients who share similar backgrounds and engage in group exercise which is both economical and effective, while also being able to participate in group chats and join and form different groups.


Features:

    Profiles
    •    Users are able to upload profile picture, showcase a personal bio for other users to see
    Emergency button
    •    Upon clicking the easily accessible emergency button, a message string with the user’s current location will populate the iPhone message input box, and the user’s emergency contact number will automatically fill in the “To:” input box
    •    The user can then simply press send
    Grouping algorithm
    •    Patients are grouped based on their location and physical condition
    •    Default groups are recommended to patients based on relevance
    Event planning with reminder 
    •    Any member in a group can create an event, which other group members can click “join”
    •    All upcoming events for the user will be displayed at the home page to serve as a reminder to the user
    •    Users who are going to the event will be reminded with the iPhone reminder one hour prior to the event
    Activity Tracker
    •    Users are able to add personal exercise logs
    •    Users can view their progress in three different histograms - daily view, weekly view, and monthly view
    •    The duration of past exercise events which users attended will be automatically accumulated on the histogram
    Friends and creating private groups
    •    Users can view the profile of other members in the same group, they can then send friend requests
    •    Users can create a private group and invite their friends into the group
    Chatting
    •    Users can communicate real time with their group members and friends using our built in chat function
